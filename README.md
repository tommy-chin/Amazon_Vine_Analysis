# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Purpose
A client company named SellBy was interested in selling their products through Amazon. Amazon provides a service called Amazon Vine which allows companies who are interested selling products through Amazon to have their products reviewed and published for consumers to see. This comes at a small fee which is why the client is interested in seeing whether or not there is any positive bias towards members of the Amazon Vine program before they decide to enroll. The dataset chosen from the Amazon reviews is a dataset containing video game reviews. This data analysis aims to see whether or not there is any sort of positive bias in this dataset towards members of Amazon Vine.
## Results

### How many vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

## Summary
As noted in the results, it would appear that there may be some positivity vias for reviews in the Vine program. This is due to 51.06% of vine member reviews having 5 star ratings while only 38.70% of non-vine member reviews received 5 star ratings. However, there was a small sample size for vine reviews since out of the 40,565 total reviews, only 94 of the reviews were vine members. It is recommended to complete another analysis of another dataset to provide more insight. Another analysis that could be done with the current dataset that would help to see if there is any bias would be to inspect the number of 1 star ratings. It is possible that vine member reviews receive a lower number of 1 star reviews as opposed to non-vine member reviews.
